🖥️ Slide 1: Title Slide

Title: Student Health Monitoring System
By: [Your Name]
Language: Java
Platform: Console-based Application
Date: [Your Presentation Date]


---

💡 Slide 2: Introduction

Purpose: To ensure students meet basic health standards before entering school/class

Key Checks:

Mask-wearing status

Body temperature


Developed using Java with Scanner for input and conditionals



---

🎯 Slide 3: Objective

Automate student health verification

Ensure COVID-like safety practices

Reduce manual checking burden on staff



---

🔧 Slide 4: Technologies Used

Tool	Purpose

Java	Core logic and input/output
Scanner class	To read user inputs
Conditionals	To evaluate mask + temperature
Console I/O	Display access status



---

🧮 Slide 5: Workflow Diagram

[Student Enters Info] 
        ↓
[Is Mask Worn?] → No → Access Denied
        ↓
[Temp ≤ 37.5?] → No → Access Denied
        ↓
       Yes
        ↓
[Access Granted]

(You can draw this using arrows or simple SmartArt in PowerPoint.)


---

🧪 Slide 6: Sample Code Snippet

if(mask.equals("yes") && temp <= 37.5) {
    System.out.println("Access granted");
} else {
    System.out.println("Access denied");
}

(Add syntax highlighting and make font large for readability)

💻 Slide 7: Demo Screenshot or Flow

Screenshot of console running

Example input/output:

Enter name: Riya
Wearing mask: yes
Temperature: 36.8
➜ Access granted



---

✅ Slide 8: Advantages

Quick and easy health verification

No external libraries required

Can be extended to GUI or database later



---

🧠 Slide 9: Future Scope

Add GUI using Java Swing

Store student logs in a database

Add ID scanner integration

Alert system for high temperature detection



PROGRAM:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class HealthCheck {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("=== Student Health Check ===");

        System.out.print("Enter student name: ");
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Is the student wearing a mask? (yes/no): ");
        String mask = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.print("Enter body temperature in Celsius: ");
        double temp = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.println("\n--- Health Check Result ---");
        if (mask.equalsIgnoreCase("yes") && temp <= 37.5) {
            System.out.println("Access granted to " + name + ".");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access denied to " + name + ".");
        }
    }
}
# HealthMonitorJava
